# Add this to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/hydra.newpaltz.edu.conf
# Place it BEFORE the DocumentRoot/Directory block that serves the React SPA
# (after the /api/events Location block is a good spot)

# Proxy /servers to hydra-saml-auth for cluster status page
<Location "/servers">
    ProxyPass http://localhost:6969/servers
    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:6969/servers
